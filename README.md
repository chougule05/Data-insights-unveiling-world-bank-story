## PROBLEM STATEMENT 


Analyze historical data of International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). This data mainly consists of Region, Country, Borrower, Guarantor, Loan Type, Loan Status, Interest Rate, Project Name, Original principal amount etc

The objective of our project is to analyze regional and country-specific trends in IBRD lending activities and to understand the characteristics of IBRD borrowers, including government entities, public agencies, private enterprises, and other organizations. The project focuses on assessing different types of loans offered by the IBRD (e.g., investment loans, development policy loans) and analyzing their status (e.g., active, closed, canceled). This could involve examining the purposes of loans, disbursement schedules, repayment terms, and project outcomes. 

Another objective is to explore the dynamics of interest rates charged by the IBRD over time and across different regions and countries.
